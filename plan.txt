daemon loop:
- set up mngmt, cpg and qmpcommands
- starts qemu with QemuLauncher -> qmp
- starts resync with ResyncManager
- sets up mainco
- calls mainco
- saves state
- deletes mainco
- loop

QemuLauncher -> stubable X
- returns qmp X
- qemu dead callback
- Optionals
- Keep MainCo as a function
  -> returns FAILED, REBOOT, SHUTDOWN, DEMOTED, PROMOTE
  - put watchdog in mainco X
- put resync in it's own file -> reusable for HA
- Command Event
- mngmt and cpg:
  - event-triggering calls into mainco use one callback
  - non-event calls go direct
  - all calls go to daemon loop, forwards either to itself or ignores if inside mainco or if inside resync
    - co_recurse() can set flag while looping in function
  - daemon loop, mainco and resync manager register themselves for callbacks
  - make everything into callback for decoupling X
- qmp templates as singleton with custom printf format X
